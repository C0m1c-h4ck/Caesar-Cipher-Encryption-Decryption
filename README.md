# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm and is built on the fundamental logic of a numeric key value, which is used to alter the position values of individual alphabets in a text. 

## Files
The project consists of the following files:
* index.html: The HTML file containing the user interface and JavaScript code.
* style.css: The CSS file for styling the user interface.
* script.js: The JavaScript file containing the implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm

## Example 

For encrytion, if you applied Caesar cipher on the text ‚ÄúSECURITY‚Äù with numeric key value as 3 then it will be converted to cipher text ‚ÄúVHFXULWB‚Äù.

For decryption, if you applied Caesar cipher on the text ‚ÄúVHFXULWB‚Äù with numeric key value as 3 then it will be converted to cipher text ‚ÄúSECURITY‚Äù.

## üöÄ Usage 
To use the Caesar cipher encryption/decryption tool, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. Select the desired operation from the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" radio button.
4. Enter the desired shift value, which determines how many positions each letter will be shifted.
5. Enter the desired modulo value, which determines the length of the alphabet.
6. Select the letter case you want maintaincase, lowercase, and uppercase.
7. Select the foreign key you want to ignore or remove, if you selected to remove it will remove symbols.
8. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input field provided.
9. Click the submit button.
10. The result will be displayed in the output section.
